## Building

How to build the funny game or something

### Installing Stuff

First, install Haxe (USE 4.2.5 BRUH) and HaxeFlixel.
* [Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/version/4.2.5/)
* [HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/install-haxeflixel/)

Then, install these or something:
```
flixel
flixel-addons
flixel-ui
hscript
```
Then, these I think:
1. Download [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Works for [Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win), [Mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac), and [Linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux), just select your build.
2. Follow instructions to install the application properly.
3. Run `haxelib git polymod https://github.com/MasterEric/polymod` to install Polymod.
4. Run `haxelib git discord_rpc https://github.com/Aidan63/linc_discord-rpc` to install Discord RPC.
5. Run `haxelib git hxCodec https://github.com/polybiusproxy/hxCodec` to install hxCodec.

Everything should be ready. You can continue from here.

### More Things

At the moment, you can optionally fix the transition bug in songs with zoomed-out cameras.
- Run `haxelib git flixel-addons https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel-addons` in the terminal/command-prompt.

And you should be good to go.

### Compilation

Once you have all those installed, it's pretty easy to compile the game. You just need to run `lime test html5 -debug` in the root of the project to build and run the HTML5 version. (command prompt navigation guide can be found here: [https://ninjamuffin99.newgrounds.com/news/post/1090480](https://ninjamuffin99.newgrounds.com/news/post/1090480))
To run it from your desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux) it can be a bit more involved. For Linux, you only need to open a terminal in the project directory and run `lime test linux -debug` and then run the executable file in export/release/linux/bin. For Windows, you need to install [Visual Studio Community 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/). While installing VSC, don't click on any of the options to install workloads. Instead, go to the individual components tab and choose the following:
* MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools
* Windows SDK (10.0.17763.0)

Once that is done you can open up a command line in the project's directory and run `lime test windows -debug`. Once that command finishes (it takes forever even on a higher end PC), you can run FNF from the .exe file under export\release\windows\bin
As for Mac, `lime test mac -debug` should work, if not the internet surely has a guide on how to compile Haxe stuff for Mac.
