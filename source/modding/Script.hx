	Base class for any scripting languages to inherit from.

	Usage:
		This class should be mainly used for creating different types
		of scripts of different languages. Like how Leather Engine supports
		both Lua and HScript, if you were to add another language
		you would just extend this (aka Python or something, idk what your plans are).
